# **App Name**: GrocerKids

## Core Features:

- Product Search: Enables users to search for products by name, suggesting results with corresponding images fetched from external APIs (Unsplash, Pexels, Open Food Facts).
- Image Catalog Integration: Fetches product images from free image APIs (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels) and Open Food Facts to display visual representations of products.
- Manual Product Entry: Allows users to manually add products with a custom image uploaded from their device, accommodating items not found in the image API.
- Dynamic List Management: Displays products in a responsive grid, automatically moving 'bought' items to the end of the list and greying them out to visually indicate progress.
- AI-Powered Image-to-List Conversion: Uses OCR technology as a tool to analyze photos of handwritten lists, identifies products from the text, and automatically adds them to the visual list with corresponding images.
- Local Storage Persistence: Saves the shopping list data locally in the browser using localStorage to enable offline access and ensure data persistence.
- Gamified Visual Interface: Presents each product as a large, tappable card with a prominent image and optional text, using bright colors and animations to engage young users.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust and reliability while remaining cheerful.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E0F7FA) to provide a soft and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Energetic yellow (#FFDA63) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and easily readable title and short text.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) as it pairs well with 'Poppins' and is suitable for longer blocks of text if needed.
- Use large, clear, and universally recognizable icons that are easy for children to understand and interact with.
- Incorporate playful and smooth animations, such as a checkmark animation when a product is marked as bought or a gentle bounce when a new product is added, to provide engaging visual feedback.
